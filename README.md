**A teachers tool for school**

A name generator that randomly goes through a list of names and outputs a random name at the end

Is the tool for you?
* are you teacher (or something similar)?
* do you have to randomly pick a name from a list on a regular bases (let`s say for a little test)?
* do you want to make the people in that list a little bit nervous (about who you are going to pick next for a test)?

You might want to try it!
